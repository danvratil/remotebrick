RemoteBrick is a multiplatform Qt application targeted at Android. It can be
used to remotely control an Arduino-powered LEGO creations through Bluetooth.

The Arduino board must run RemoteBrick Arduino software (otherwise they won't
understand each other :)

The software for the Arduino board is in the [remotebrick-arduino](https://github.com/danvratil/remotebrick-arduino) repository.
